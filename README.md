## 🎬 Project Overview
Welcome to the **"MOVIE POLL INLÄMNING"** project, the zenith of blockchain-based movie voting solutions! 🎉 We have created this *earth-shattering* smart contract application because let's face it: what humanity needs more than anything right now is a decentralized way to vote for movies. 🍿 We could have solved world hunger or invented teleportation, but no, we chose movies. And you're welcome! 😎

### What Does This Do?
It's a blockchain-based movie voting system, of course! 📊 You can propose, vote, and fight with your friends over which movie should be watched next. 🍿 And it's decentralized, so it's basically the future. 🚀 Or at least it will be once everyone learns how to use MetaMask. 🦊

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Before diving into this awe-inspiring project, you need a few things:

1. **🖥️ Node.js and npm**: If you don't know what this is, then I don't know what you're doing here. But still, go [download it](https://nodejs.org/). Now. 🏃‍♂️
2. **🏗️ Hardhat**: Because why not add another tool to your never-ending list of things to install. 🛠️
3. **👩‍💻 Solidity Knowledge**: If you've never heard of Solidity, this README is about to get very confusing for you. 🤯 It's the language used to write smart contracts. Not to be confused with 'solidarity,' which you’ll need from your friends when debugging. 🫂
4. **😌 Patience**: Because deploying contracts on a testnet is like watching paint dry. 🖌️ But slower. 🕰️

## 💻 Installation
Alright, strap in and follow these steps to install this masterpiece:

1. 🧑‍💻 Clone the repo like your life depends on it (because it might):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MOVIE-POLL-INL-MNING.git
    ```

2. 📁 Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MOVIE-POLL-INL-MNING
    ```

3. 📦 Install dependencies, and try not to fall asleep:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. 🏗️ Compile the contracts using Hardhat:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

5. 🙏 Pray to the blockchain gods for smooth deployment. ⛩️

## 🗳️ Usage
1. **🚀 Deploy the Contract**: Make sure you're on a testnet, because if you deploy this on mainnet accidentally, you'll be the star of a very embarrassing Reddit thread. 😱

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run 
    ```

2. **🎥 Vote for a Movie**: Propose, vote, and maybe bribe others to vote for your movie choice. 💵 Voting is simple, unless you have no friends, in which case it might be a bit lonely. 😢

3. **🍿 Enjoy Your Decentralized Movie Night**: Sit back, grab some popcorn, and bask in the knowledge that you are now watching movies in the most unnecessarily complex way possible. 🥳

## 📂 File Structure
Here's a rundown of the project's architecture, because why not make this even longer? 🤓

- **📄 contracts/MovieVoting.sol**: The smart contract where all the magic (and bugs) happen. 🪄🐛
- **🧪 test/MovieVoting.ts**: Tests to make sure everything is not completely broken. 🛠️
- **🗃️ ignition/**: Deployment scripts because we didn't want to type those commands ourselves every time. 📝
- **📝 README.md**: The file you’re reading now. Yes, it’s aware of its existence. Spooky, right? 👻

## 🤝 Contributing
Want to contribute? We thought you’d never ask! 😍 Fork the repo, make some changes, and open a pull request. Just remember: with great code comes great responsibility. 🕷️

## 📜 License
This project is licensed under the MIT License, which basically means you can do almost anything with it except claim that you wrote the original README. 😜

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Why did you create this project?**  
A: Because we could. 💪 And also because we wanted to solve the problem of movie night indecision. 🤔

**Q: How do I vote for a movie?**  
A: Use the smart contract, obviously. 📜 What, did you think this was a Google Forms survey? 😂

**Q: Why is the README so long?**  
A: Because if you’ve made it this far, you deserve an award. 🏆

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. 🎓 Don’t bet your life savings on it, or use it as your only method of choosing movies. 🎲 Also, we take no responsibility for family arguments arising from movie choices. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## 🧐 How to Read This README
Start from the top and work your way down. 👇 Or just skip to the end, who am I to tell you how to live your life? 🤷‍♂️

## 😺 A Special Thanks to My Cat
For sitting on my keyboard and almost deploying this to mainnet by accident. You’re the real MVP. 🏅😼

## 🔮 The Meaning of Life
42. Also, decentralized movie voting. 🎥🍿
