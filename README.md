# Decentralized Movie Voting Contract

This repository features a smart contract written in Solidity, designed for a decentralized movie voting system. The contract enables users to initiate voting sessions, submit votes for their favorite films, and determine the top movie after the voting period concludes.

## Key Features

- **Create Voting Sessions**: Users can start a voting session by providing a list of movies and setting a time limit for the vote.
- **Cast Votes**: Once a session begins, participants can vote for their preferred films.
- **Announce the Winner**: After the voting deadline, the contract calculates and announces the movie with the most votes.
- **Built-in Security**: The contract utilizes OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` to defend against common security threats like reentrancy attacks.
- **Optimized for Gas Efficiency**: It minimizes gas costs by reducing unnecessary storage reads and handling likely failure conditions early.

## Testing Process

The contract includes a thorough set of unit tests to validate its functionality, covering both the main features and edge cases. These tests are implemented using Hardhat, incorporating tools such as Chai for assertions and Hardhat Network Helpers for manipulating time.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract.
- **Hardhat**: Used for Ethereum development and testing.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Provides secure contract libraries, including `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **TypeScript**: Used in test scripts and module development.

## Getting Started

To deploy and test the contract locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Execute the tests using `npx hardhat test`.
